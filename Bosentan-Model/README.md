# Bosentan-Model
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of bosentan
# Description
A whole-body PBPK model of bosentan is distributed within this repository. The structure of this model includes the OATP1B1/1B3-mediated active uptake, CYP2C9- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of bosentan, and bosentan-mediated induction of CYP3A4 and inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3. The model was developed and evaluated for describing bosentan's hepatic disposition, systemic plasma, and in excreta. Details can be found in reference [1].
# Version Information
The PBPK model was developed using OSP Suite Version 11.0 (Build - 150).
# License
The model is distributed under the GPLv2 License.
